# Sybil Attacks and Sybil Resistance

Sybil Attacks occur when one individual takes on numerous accounts or identities to gain an unfair advantage in a network. Sybil Attacks remain the biggest “open problem” and largest blocker to innovation throughout the crypto space due to core tenets of the space:

1. &#x20;Open, Permissionless Access: Any individual anywhere in the world can opt-in to participate in crypto networks&#x20;
2. &#x20;Financialized Interactions: The space as a whole operates according to incentivized coordination, attaching explicit economic value to individual interactions.

These two features of the space together enforce an environment where users have minimum barriers against Sybil Attacks and direct incentives for carrying out said attacks.

The ultimate crypto solution to Sybil Attacks must satisfy the following criteria:

* Easily accessible: Minimized friction in user sign-up process and integration for clients.
* Private & Secure: Protecting users' identities and maintaining the ethos of open, permissionless access.
* Massively Scaling: Defense that supports millions of users (or more).
* Effective: Sybil Resistance tools that are effective in preventing Sybil Attacks.

To this, the team has driven a thesis behind the ability to utilize Biometrics as the cornucopia Sybil Resistance protocol.
