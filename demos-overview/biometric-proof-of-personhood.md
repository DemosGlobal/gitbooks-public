# Biometric Proof of Personhood

More discreetly, Demos' approach to solving Sybil Resistance via OnlyMeID categorizes the project within the "Biometric Proof of Personhood" niche.

Proof of Personhood (PoP) broadly refers to practices that enable real humans to verify some attributes or aspects of themselves to assert their existence online and on-chain as a person (as opposed to a bot). The PoP sector comprises "social oracles" - systems that allow users to prove off-chain credentials on-chain, as well as "on-chain identity" functionalities that package user on-chain interactions in a way that establishes on-chain credit or reputation.

Biometric Proof of Personhood is a niche within PoP that corresponds to using an individual's biometric input to establish personhood.
