# Demos Overview

The integrity of the Demos enrollment system is paramount. The OnlyMeID protocol has undergone extensive User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure its integrity, reliability, and seamless enrollment performance. We fortify our commitment to security by integrating cutting-edge global security innovations and establishing a world-class, on-chain security solution that protects personal and sensitive data.

&#x20;

As part of our robust security framework, Demos reserves the right to refuse access to the system at our discretion. Demos do not require justification for any refusal, ensuring an efficient and secure enrollment experience for all users while maintaining the highest data protection standards.

&#x20;

Our top priority is the security of our protocol, and we continue to monitor and update our systems to meet evolving global security standards.
