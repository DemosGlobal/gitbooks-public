# Safeguards to Prevent Misuse

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Minimum Enrollment Time**</mark>: There's a mandatory minimum enrollment time to deter misuse of the purge feature, such as attempting to bypass Sybil protection by re-enrolling. Users must wait for this period (e.g., one week) after their initial enrollment before they can initiate a purge.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Verification Checks:**</mark> Before the purge is executed, users undergo additional verification checks. This step ensures that the request is legitimate and not the result of a compromised account.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Audit Trails:**</mark> While personal data is purged, an anonymized audit trail is maintained for a limited period. This trail is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system and for audit purposes, ensuring that the purge process itself cannot be exploited.
