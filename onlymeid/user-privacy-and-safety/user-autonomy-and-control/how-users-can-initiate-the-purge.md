# How Users Can Initiate the Purge

* **User Dashboard:** Users can initiate the purge directly from their OnlyMeID dashboard. This dashboard is accessible once they log in using their blockchain address.
* **Purge Option:** Within the dashboard, there's a clearly marked option for "Purge biometrics." Selecting this option will start the purge process.
* **Confirmation Steps:** To prevent accidental deletions, users are asked to confirm their intention through a multi-step process. This includes the user initiating their own OnlyMeID burn onchain and confirming their choice to purge their data.
