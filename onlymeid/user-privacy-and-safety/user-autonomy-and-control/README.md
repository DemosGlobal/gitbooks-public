# User Autonomy and Control

In our commitment to user privacy and autonomy, DEMOS offers a feature known as the "Permissionless Purge." This functionality empowers users with the ultimate control over their data, allowing them to delete their enrollment in OnlyMeID without needing permission from any external authority. Here's a closer look at how this process works and the safeguards we've implemented to prevent misuse while ensuring user autonomy.&#x20;
