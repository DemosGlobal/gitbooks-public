# Biometric Authentication

OnlyMeID utilizes Biometric Proof of Personhood protocol, leveraging advanced biometric indicators to authenticate users uniquely and securely. Here's a closer look at the process and its significance:

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Enrollment Process:**</mark> Users engage with a selfie interface, following prompts that guide them through a series of head movements. This interaction, captured via the device's camera, is processed in seconds, showcasing the efficiency and user-friendliness of the system.
2. <mark style="color:yellow;">**AI Assessment:**</mark> The core of OnlyMeID's authentication process lies in its AI's ability to analyze numerous facial indicators. This AI generates a summary output hash, providing a “score” that evaluates the user's uniqueness and authenticity.
3. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Dual Tests for Authentication:**</mark>

* Proof of Uniqueness: Confirms the user's input as genuine and distinct from any previous entries, ensuring each enrollment is tied to a unique individual.
* Proof of Liveness: Available for previously enrolled users, this test verifies ongoing authenticity by matching new input against existing records, akin to FaceID technology.
* Proof of Humanity: A simplified verification that doesn't require an account but confirms the user is not a bot, similar to CAPTCHA services.
