OnlyMeID provides a robust framework for identity verification within Web3 environments, harnessing biometric data to ensure the uniqueness and authenticity of each user. This system facilitates secure and trustworthy user interactions by linking off-chain biometric verification with on-chain attestations, creating a seamless bridge between real-world identity and digital presence.

The enrollment process is the initial step for a user to validate their identity using OnlyMeID. It involves several critical steps designed to establish and confirm the user's unique human identity:

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">Wallet Connection and Ownership Confirmation:</mark>

* Users start by connecting their Web3 wallet to the OnlyMeID platform.
* They then sign a message to confirm ownership of the connected wallet, establishing a link between their digital wallet and their physical identity.



2. <mark style="color:yellow;">Biometric Verification:</mark>

* Users provide a live selfie during the enrollment process.
* This selfie is vetted for authenticity to ensure it is not tampered with or digitally altered.
* It is also compared against other enrollments to confirm the uniqueness of the user, preventing duplicate identities within the system.

3. <mark style="color:yellow;">On-Chain Identity Minting:</mark>

* Upon successful enrollment, users are granted permission to mint their MeID on-chain.
* This MeID token acts as a digital attestation of their enrollment and unique human identity, securely stored on the blockchain.

The enrollment process not only verifies but also affirms the 'unique human-ness' of each user, integrating their biometric data with blockchain technology to create a reliable identity marker.

Post-enrollment, users can engage with the OnlyMeID system to periodically verify their identity. This verification process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and currency of user identities within the system:

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">Reconnection and Identity Confirmation:</mark>

* Users reconnect their wallet associated with an existing OnlyMeID enrollment.
* This step ensures that the digital identity is still controlled by the same user.

2. <mark style="color:yellow;">Live Selfie Verification:</mark>

* Users provide a new live selfie, which is vetted for authenticity similarly to the enrollment process.
* The new selfie is compared against previous enrollment and verification records for similarity matching, confirming the userâ€™s consistent identity over time.

3. <mark style="color:yellow;">On-Chain Verification Update:</mark>

* Following successful verification, users are allowed to update their OMeID enrollment on-chain.
* A timestamp is added to their on-chain record, attesting to the latest sign-in and verification, enhancing the security and relevance of the identity verification.

This verification process serves as a 'Proof of Liveness' attestation, crucial for high-stakes integrations where real-time identity confirmation is necessary to prevent misuse, such as through over-the-counter (OTC) account transfers.

OnlyMeID is particularly valuable for environments requiring high levels of security and identity assurance. It prevents the abuse of services by ensuring that all accounts are tied to a verified and continually updated biometric identity, safeguarding against unauthorized account transfers and enhancing overall system integrity.
