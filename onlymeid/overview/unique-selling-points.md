# Unique Selling Points

**Ease of Use**

DEMOS is maximally easy for users to sign up, offering a single \~30 second signup across usersâ€™ existing devices. Worldcoin requires a physical appointment, and other competitors like Idena require routine, cumbersome verification processes to maintain validation.

**Simple, Permissionless Integration**

DEMOS offers public, universal, on-chain "Human Verified" attestations. Any project can easily protect their Smart Contracts by adding just **one line of code** to the corresponding function. Dev docs are straightforward and enable projects to integrate OnlyMeID and onboard their community without any negotiations required!

**Token Alignment**

$DEM follows a lockup membership model, aligning token incentives and privileges with an emphasis on community activation. The focus on token lockup supports healthy tokenomics that align $DEM with the success of the project as a whole.&#x20;

**Crypto-native Implementation**

DEMOS is specifically designed to serve Web3/blockchain companies, providing a solution that is tailored to the needs of this industry that needs it most. Users enroll with the existing wallet address they are already interacting with and projects do not need to dedicate engineering resources around SDKs, APIs, or adapaters - it's all on-chain!

**On-Chain Business Model**

Many other projects offering a "Public Service" like Demos are not designed from inception with an appropriate business model. By baking costs and revenue directly into the on-chain interactions, Demos can guarantee revenue alignment with usage and additionally pass those responsibilities through token governance.

**Privacy and Security**

DEMOS does not use an opaque, first-party algorithm that stores raw data which could be repurposed. All biometric activity remains 100% off-chain, and users can permissionlessly purge their enrollment if they so choose. This ensures a high level of privacy and security for users.
