# Membership System

Users can lock $DEM tokens to initiate a “membership” within the Demos ecosystem.&#x20;

The minimum $DEM lockup position establishes users as ecosystem Members, granting Demos ecosystem privileges:

1. &#x20;Economic incentives for work completed
2. &#x20;First-party & partner opportunities/rewards/privileges across the ecosystem
3. Governance Participation
4. Further $DEM Rewards

Members of Demos will autonomously carry out work assigned to them. This work includes:

* Referring users to sign up for OnlyMeID
* Referring projects to integrate OnlyMeID
* Performing meaningful DAO operations (ex: governance participation)

Membership in Demos also corresponds to the gamified "leaderboard" system, where engaged and active community members compete and cooperate to evangelize and build Demos.
