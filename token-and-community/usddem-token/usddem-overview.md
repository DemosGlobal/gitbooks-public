# $DEM Overview

Demos represent a tokenized product stack, starting with OnlyMeID, which offers a universal solution for web3 projects to “human gate” certain aspects of their project against sybil attacks as they see best fit.

Leveraging lessons learned from the broader crypto space, Demos is designed to encompass a model that satisfies all of the following simultaneously:

1. Eloquently incentivize community members, regardless of capital, to perform well-defined, concrete, good work that simultaneously benefits both individual and protocol.
2. &#x20;Distinguish a scaling, a future-proof revenue model that supports a defined, focused vision for the team and project.
3. &#x20;Protect the rights and interests of passive holders who cannot dedicate energy to the project but continue to support it with their token holdings and confidence in the project and community.
4. &#x20;Establish discrete governance and administrative responsibilities for token holders from the project's inception.

In doing so, Demos unlocks a model that grows and succeeds directly with the confidence and evangelism of token holders. Due to the nature of Demos and OnlyMeID, our ability to succeed hinges entirely on the ability of community members to extend our network. Our token and broader project mechanics help to maintain a positive relationship where token holders are incentivized personally for the good work required of them to succeed.
