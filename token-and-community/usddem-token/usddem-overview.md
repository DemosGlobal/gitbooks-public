# $DEM Overview

## **Comprehensive Token Utility**

The $DEM token represents a cornerstone of the DEMOS product ecosystem, beginning with OnlyMeID, which provides a universal solution for Web3 projects to secure their operations against Sybil attacks.

The design principles behind $DEM are aimed at achieving the following goals simultaneously:

* Broad Incentivization: Encouraging community members, irrespective of their investment capacity, to undertake valuable, clearly defined tasks that benefit both the individual and the protocol.
* Scalable Revenue Model: Supporting a robust and adaptable economic framework that aligns with the project's long-term vision.
* Protection for Passive Holders: Safeguarding the interests of supporters who are less actively involved but sustain the project with their capital and trust.
* Governance and Administration: Establishing clear roles and responsibilities for token holders from the outset, ensuring effective oversight and decision-making.

As a result, the $DEM token system is designed to thrive on community confidence and advocacy, essential for DEMOS's ongoing success and scalability.
