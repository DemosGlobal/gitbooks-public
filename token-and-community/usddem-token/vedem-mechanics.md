# veDEM Mechanics

The lockup process adheres to the “veNFT” methodology. When users lockup $DEM, they receive an NFT representing their position. Users set a lockup time when they create their position, which translates to a corresponding locked $DEM value.

Users can always burn their membership and retrieve their underlying position minus an early exit fee. This fee begins at 75% and decreases linearly throughout the lockup.

Users can increase their membership position, but it may reset their lockup.

Users can transfer their membership freely. On the open market, membership NFTs may carry some floating value between the total value of their $DEM lockup and the current tokens received on an early exit.
