# Overview

Demos uses an OnlyMeID-gated Quadratic consensus model associated with Memberships.

Members who hold OnlyMeID can participate in governance. Their weight is equal to their lockup size, and a quadratic formula (depth + breadth of voting) determines consensus. In the case that a Member holds multiple NFT positions, only their largest position is counted for governance weight.

Additionally to the global governance mechanisms, top performers on the Leaderboard may receive further governance privileges as "DAO Executives". These individuals are the most engaged, highest-performing members of the Demos community. Through this system, Executives can work more closely and fluidly with the core team to ensure alignment and promote the collective interests of the Demos ecosystem.
