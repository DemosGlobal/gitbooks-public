# Demos Leaderboard

Demos offers a maximally gamified community engagement program through its novel leaderboard mechanism.

When users do good work in the Demos community, such as refer new sign-ups and project integrations, they begin to receive points. They may also receive points doing some combination of the following activities:

* Voting in DAO governance
* Performing micro-work for the DAO
* Participation in community events and promotions

Users can also qualify for points through their existing veDEM membership NFTs. This drives further gamification that gives community evangelists the choice between prioritize their token holdings or their engagement with the project itself.

### Leaderboard Mechanics

Activity performed by users is tracked on the [Demos leaderboard](https://demos.global/leaderboard). This leaderboard exists as a "meta-aggregator" of internal and external campaigns corresponding to the Demos ecosystem. **Internal campaigns** are set up by Demos itself and may correspond to internal DAO activities like app testing, DAO governance, community participation, and so on. **External campaigns** take advantage of questing providers or otherwise engagement programs across defined "Sprints". This activity could look like affiliate/referral programs, social engagement programs, etc.&#x20;

Both types of campaigns are situated competitively, where participation is ranked and scored by factors such as timing (i.e., First to test a Demos app), volume (i.e., most OnlyMeID referrals), or quality (i.e., best-performing Social Media posts).

After these campaigns conclude, top performers earn **badges**. Badges have some value on the Demos Leaderboard that corresponds to an absolute number of points and/or benefits that will help users earn more points in the future.

So many campaigns are bundled into **Seasons.** At the end of the season, all user activity is compiled according to the badges earned, and those users are ranked into levels**.**

The level that a user achieves at the end of the season corresponds to their rewards for that season as well as perks, privileges, and bonuses throughout the next season.

### Leaderboard Incentives

Individuals receive increasing access to incentives as they earn more points and reach higher levels. These incentives include (from least to most exclusive):

* First-Party and Partner Perks (ex: Whitelist)
* Physical rewards (conference tickets, meetups, Demos swag)
* $DEM payouts/airdrops
* DAO “Executive” Status
* Revenue Share

### Top-Heavy Skew

Revenue share, as the most coveted incentive, is gated to only the very top (10-20) individuals. This is designed to maximally reward the most productive community members (large token lockers + heavyweight affiliates).

By gamifying and gating these incentives to the top achievers, Demos can reduce the actual units of revenue and tokens airdropped while still offering a very enticing payout per user for those eligible.
