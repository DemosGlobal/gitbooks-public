# Demos / Hemi Overview

Addressing questions raised on why wallet owners require a re-verification.

There are two parts to the Demos Enrollment process

1\)      <mark style="color:yellow;">**Proof of Existence**</mark> | Enroll your wallet and identity through sign-up (off-chain)

2\)      <mark style="color:yellow;">**OnlyMeID Token**</mark> | After enrolling off-chain, mint a MeID token on-chain.

3\)      <mark style="color:yellow;">**Proof of Liveness**</mark> | When active, the option to ‘verify’ on-chain to verify your wallet ownership. The timestamp will be displayed in the Demos UI (dApp)

&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Re-verification**</mark>, or officially ‘[<mark style="color:yellow;">**Proof of**</mark> ](../../demos-overview/biometric-proof-of-personhood.md)<mark style="color:yellow;">**Liveness'**</mark>, is a service in which Demos provide continued protocol integrity. Demos Global, to date, is unique in providing the option for continued verification, which is recorded on-chain and can be used for many outcomes.

\-          Periodic check-ins to accumulate points or rewards requested by a protocol ie Hemi

\-          Confidence: The person who enrolled on a wallet remains the person who initially enrolled, which is the core mantra of Demos Global: ‘<mark style="color:yellow;">1 person, 1 wallet</mark>’.

\-          Last active timestamp on-chain.

Snapshot voting | Confidence: The wallets contributing to votes could be requested to ensure they have updated their on-chain POP before each vote or after a specific period for a continued 1-person 1 wallet trust.

\-          Additional user cases detailed here: [https://docs.demos.global/onlymeid/overview/use-cases](../../onlymeid/overview/use-cases.md)

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Demos Global System Integrity</mark>

&#x20;The integrity of the Demos enrollment system is paramount. The OnlyMeID protocol has undergone extensive User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure its integrity, reliability, and seamless enrollment performance. We fortify our commitment to security by integrating cutting-edge global security innovations and establishing a world-class, on-chain security solution that protects personal and sensitive data.

&#x20;As part of our robust security framework, Demos reserves the right to refuse access to the system at our discretion. Demos do not require justification for any refusal, ensuring an efficient and secure enrollment experience for all users while maintaining the highest data protection standards.

&#x20;Our top priority is the security of our protocol, and we continue to monitor and update our systems to meet evolving global security standards.

&#x20;The company has limited capacity to service edge case users reporting client-side issues primarily due to a lack of technical knowledge of our products. These issues include claims of unawareness of prior enrollments and verifications on another device or in a previous period and how to connect a wallet. Information that has been provided numerous times.

&#x20;<mark style="color:yellow;">**Swarms & Face Harvesting**</mark>

Based on intelligent traffic patterns and behaviour analysis, the company can make positive decisions that ensure and reinforce the system's stability, which is not influenced by individual user awareness or actions.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Discord Terms & Conditions.**</mark>

&#x20;Users in Discord who continue to report incorrect and misleading information to other users risk a ban. Information has been provided to advise to engage the Demos support team via email, which users can utilise.

&#x20;For users who repeatedly contact the Demos support team claiming their wallet has been incorrectly flagged as a duplicate, the support team responds to all initial inquiries, providing relevant information, including details about the enrolled wallet and steps for resolution.

&#x20;In some cases, individuals fail to accept and acknowledge they are enrolled on an alternative wallet. Unfortunately, the Demos support team cannot offer a solution for users who are unaware of how they enrolled on a different wallet.&#x20;

Furthermore, on occasions, traffic patterns indicate a high volume of users enrolling through shared devices, which aligns with other protocol patterns and face harvesting to secure an identity on a wallet for gain. This activity can contribute to challenges managing multiple wallets associated with a single device or PC, potentially leading to a confused user experience when users have enrolled already but the device owner is unaware.
