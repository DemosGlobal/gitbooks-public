# ðŸ”¥ How to burn/delete enrollment

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Steps to change/burn/delete your enrollment & MEID token</mark>

#### IMPORTANT NOTE: <mark style="color:green;">To follow the process of changing wallets, the wallet must have minted a MEID Token. If a person has just enrolled without minting a MEID token, the process can not be followed; therefore</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">minting a MEID is always required to change wallets.</mark>&#x20;

_In summary If enrolled but not minted, mint a MEID token, follow steps below <mark style="color:yellow;">noting a MEID token has to exist for at least 3 days before burning</mark>._

Prior Checks: **Ensure the wallet has ETH available in wallet to burn MeID token**&#x20;

a) Go to url [https://app.demos.global/dashboard/hemi](https://app.demos.global/dashboard/hemitest)

b) Connect the wallet that was enrolled {Onboarded}&#x20;

c) Go to the â€˜_<mark style="color:yellow;">**settings**</mark>_â€™ button and click on â€˜_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Burn MeID**</mark>_â€™, where you will be prompted for a confirmation that you wish to delete your MeID Enrollment (step 1) . Click on â€˜_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Yes, burn my token**</mark>_â€™. From here your wallet will prompt the person to sign a message authorising the transaction to burn enrollment.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**if â€˜settingsâ€™ are not available, clear cookies and cache or try a different browser \[Important to note, The MeID token needs to be older than 3 days to burn the token; therefore if the age of the token is less than 3 days a timer will appear}**</mark>&#x20;

d) If the wallet doesnâ€™t have MeID tokens on other chains and deleting MeiD is successful, you will see an option to â€˜_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Mint**</mark>_â€™ again. <mark style="color:purple;">**DO NOT MINT**</mark>**&#x20;again unless required.**&#x20;

e) To complete the next stages, click on â€˜_<mark style="color:yellow;">**settings**</mark>_â€™ then â€˜_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Purge MeID enrollment**</mark>_â€™; a prompt will ask for confirmation from there. To delete, choose â€˜_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Deactivate account**</mark>_â€™&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Purge biometrics will only appear if MeID has been burnt</p></figcaption></figure>

f) <mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT**</mark>**:** A timeout will appear confirming the data is being deleted; return after a timeout to enroll a new person on the wallet. **If a wallet has been tagged as a duplicate, the error message will remain displayed until a successful enrollment has been completed.**\
\
If the connected wallet detects a duplicate enrollment in the system, the following message will be displayed: _<mark style="color:green;">**"Our records show that the biometrics associated with the connected wallet are already enrolled on a different wallet. If the biometrics have been deleted and you wish to switch wallets, a successful enrollment will clear the error message. However, if you have attempted to enroll on multiple wallets, there is a risk that the warning may not resolve."**</mark>_



<mark style="color:yellow;">IMPORTANT NOTE</mark>: <mark style="color:yellow;">Once the 7-day wallet enrollment timeout is over, the person can attempt to enroll in another wallet. If a wallet was tagged as a duplicate, if the person successfully enrolls in that wallet, the message will disappear. If the person has attempted to enroll in another wallet, the message will continue to display.</mark>
