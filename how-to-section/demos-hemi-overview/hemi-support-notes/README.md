### <mark style="color:yellow;">High level Overview</mark>

Deleting your enrollment and burning your token will provide the following.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[1st Stage]**</mark> Delete MeID Token on all chains | From 3 days of enrolling, a wallet can firstly ‘burn’ or delete their MEID token 1st. The token was minted with a face after enrollment. **{Warning , 3 day timout to burn a MeID token}**&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[2nd Stage]**</mark> Delete MeID Enrollment | After the MEID Token has been deleted, there will be an option to burn/delete the MEID enrollment associated with the wallet. The option to delete the MEID Enrollment will only appear once the MeID token is deleted. **Important to note**: If you have minted a MeID token on other chains, e.g., Polygon, you will need to burn the token on those chains, too. Switching to other chains is available on the page.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[3rd Stage]**</mark> Purging account data | When stages 1 & 2 are complete, a message will appear advising to return after 24 hours, when the enrollment will be deleted from the system. The message will display a countdown. A new person cannot enrol on the wallet until the timeout has been completed. When steps 1 and 2 are complete, the enrollment and token have been deleted, and timeout \[stage 3] has timed out, that wallet is no longer owned or associated with DEMOS MeID system or contract. **Very Important Note: If a wallet has been tagged as a DUPLICATE, the wallet will be untagged and error removed after a peson successfully enrolls on the flagged wallet. If the person has purged their enrollment on another wallet, they can attempt to enroll on the flagged wallet.**

When steps 1, 2, and 3 are complete, anyone with access to that wallet can enroll again and mint a token. It is important to note that some users may not have minted a MeID token and want to change wallets. If this is true, the person must follow step 2 to delete their enrollment.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Enrollment logic and policies**</mark>

1. The basic principle of the Demos solution.

<mark style="color:yellow;">1 WALLET > 1 ENROLLMENT > 1 MEID TOKEN ON HEMI TESTNET PERMITTED</mark>

2. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Duplicate Warnings**</mark> | If a person is enrolled in the DEMOS system and the enrolled person attempts to enroll on any additional wallets, that wallet will be FLAGGED AS A DUPLICATE.

**When a wallet is flagged as a duplicate, an error will be displayed until a user successfully enrolls on the wallet which maybe after a purge on another wallet.**

3. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Purge/Delete Enrollment**</mark> | If a person decides to change wallets, please consider the following

&#x20;         \-  Burning MeID token will require 3 days timeout after activation of the delete

&#x20;          \- Each person can only own 1 MeID token on Hemi Testnet, so it doesn’t matter how often a    person switches wallets. If they mint a token, everyone will only be enrolled once with 1 MeID token.

&#x20;        \- There are two parts to deleting your profile from Demos

&#x20;                 \--<mark style="color:yellow;">Burn MeID token if minted (3-day timeout) --Delete enrollment (7-day timeout)</mark>

4. When the purge/deletion has been completed, and the person must use another wallet previously tagged as a duplicate, please look at point 2 above.

**The DEMOS team must assess any wallet flagged as a duplicate.**

5. **Settings Button:** If the button doesn’t appear, ensure the connected wallet has ETH for transactions.
6. _Enroll_ button: Users report that the button is unavailable. When a person moves their mouse over it, the button changes to yellow.
7. Once steps have been completed to a) burn MeID token and b) Delete/purge your enrollment the person can enroll on another wallet which will include a wallet that is tagged as a duplicate.
