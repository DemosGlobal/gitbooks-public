# Common reported issues

### _<mark style="color:yellow;">#1 Enrollment failed due to duplicate enrollment</mark>_

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Error**</mark>**&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**'Could not complete your verification due to a duplicate enrollment'**</mark>_

When attempting to enroll, if presented with the following message ‘_<mark style="color:yellow;">Could not complete your verification due to a duplicate enrollment</mark>_’ and the image below, the system has detected a different person who has attempted to enroll on the wallet previously.

&#x20;To explain further, if <mark style="color:blue;">\[Person 1]</mark> attempts to enrol on <mark style="color:green;">\[Wallet 1]</mark> it fails due to environmental conditions, such as lighting conditions, face positioning, etc. If <mark style="color:blue;">\[Person 1]</mark> fails enrollment and <mark style="color:purple;">\[person 2]</mark> attempts to enrol on <mark style="color:green;">\[Wallet 1</mark>], this will fail on <mark style="color:green;">\[Wallet 1]</mark>. Please contact support@demos.global for advise.\

### <mark style="color:yellow;">#3 Request failed—TypeError’</mark>

These errors could be from either the Hemi blockchain or a person repeatedly hitting refresh in their browser, which would result in a large number of requests being sent that are blocked due to security rate controls. Recommend using a different browser or attemp to use another time.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">#5 \[Wallet connection Errors]</mark>

&#x20;If people are experiencing issues connecting Metamask to the Demos website, we recommend using other supported wallets that can use 'Wallet Connect', Rabby, OKX, etc.; all are supported. Metamask deployed changes in December, which have affected its stability.

We are not advising users to create a new wallet address; they can import their private keys into other supported wallets and connect via ‘Wallet Connect’
